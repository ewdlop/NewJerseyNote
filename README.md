The phrase "Make Jersey Great Again" has been utilized in various contexts within New Jersey, reflecting efforts to address political, social, and environmental issues in the state. Here are some notable instances:

**1. Political Advocacy and Grassroots Movements**

- **Common Sense Club**: Established in late 2021, this organization aims to engage New Jersey residents in political discourse and action. With over 150,000 members, it focuses on addressing state challenges, including high outmigration and economic concerns. The club supports local candidates and emphasizes grassroots involvement to influence state policies. 

**2. Environmental and Sustainability Initiatives**

- **Sustainable Jersey**: Launched in 2009, this program collaborates with municipalities and schools to promote sustainability across New Jersey. It provides tools, training, and financial incentives to support local sustainability programs. Over the years, Sustainable Jersey has awarded more than $3.1 million in grants to schools and districts, fostering community-based projects that enhance the quality of life in the state. 

**3. Cultural and Community Projects**

- **Juneteenth NJ Festival**: Initiated in 2020, this festival celebrates Black culture and educates attendees about Juneteenth. The event has grown significantly, attracting thousands of participants and featuring performances, marketplaces of Black-owned businesses, and educational activities. It serves as a vital cultural touchstone for New Jersey's Black community, promoting community pride and educational outreach. 

**4. Political Campaigns**

- **Republican Strategies**: In recent years, Republican activists have focused on shifting New Jersey's political landscape. For instance, Scott Presler, a prominent voter-registration activist, has been working to turn New Jersey, traditionally a Democratic state, Republican. His organization engages with communities across the state to register Republican voters, aiming to influence upcoming elections. 

These initiatives, among others, reflect the diverse efforts under the "Make Jersey Great Again" banner, each aiming to address specific challenges and opportunities within the state.
